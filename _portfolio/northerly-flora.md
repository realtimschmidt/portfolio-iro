Molly Gaeckle grows and sells organic flowers in Minneapolis, Minnesota and she needed a website. The website had to:
<ul>
<li>Tell her story and describe how a cut flower CSA functions</li>
<li>Accept a specific number of shares along with payment</li>
<li>Molly needed the ability to update content on her own without the help of a developer</li>
</ul>

Molly and I were set on using <a href="https://www.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">Squarespace</a> as the content management system but we weren't sure how to set up the inventory tracking she required for a CSA. I set up a few order/purchase methods for Molly to review and after customizing it with her, we were ready to launch the site and take payments.

<blockquote>"Tim helped me create a website for my business on Squarespace. He made the process so easy and stress-free for me! I described some general ideas for the design and tools of website, and he turned it into something really beautiful and easy to use. He walked me through the different account options and did research to find out the best option for my business. We had a few rounds of edits and Tim was great at listening to me, and quickly following up with clear communication of his changes. Not only did he get my website up and running well, he trained me on how to utilize some of Squarespace’s features so that I can manage and maintain my website on a regular basis. I cannot recommend Tim’s website services enough, I’m thrilled with how mine turned out!"

Three weeks after launching the site, Molly was nearly sold out of inventory for summer 2017.
