Molly Gaeckle asked me to make a website to promote and take payments for her Minneapolis/St. Paul cut flower CSA. In Molly's case, the best user experience for her cutsomers and for her to make updates on her own led us to a Squarespace site.

Check it out and order your own share of cut flowers - <a href="https://www.northerlyflora.com/" target="_blank">https://www.northerlyflora.com/</a>
