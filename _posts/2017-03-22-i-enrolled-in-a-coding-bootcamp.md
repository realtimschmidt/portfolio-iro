title: I Enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp
---
TL;DR - Coding bootcamps are great. Try Bloc if you're on the move or looking for a remote bootcamp. Some things about me - YAY!

Coding bootcamps are the latest attraction for people looking to gain tech skills for their current role or go all in on a complete career change. After working in content management systems for a number of years, listening to developer podcasts and reviewing a long list of coding bootcamps for months, I understood the attraction and finally enrolled in a coding bootcamp. I'm almost halfway through a 6 month web developer bootcamp and although I'm looking forward to ending this rigorous pace, I love everything I've learned so far and can't wait to learn more.

It took me about 8 months of thorough consideration before I enrolled in a bootcamp. In the spring of 2016, I started listening to <a href="http://learntocodewith.me/" target="_blank">Learn to Code with Me</a> by Laurence Bradford, <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/" target="_blank">Course Report</a> and <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/reply-all/" target="_blank">Reply All</a>. Shortly after my podcast binge, I began researching and attending info sessions for a number of bootcamps including <a href="https://nycda.com/" target="_blank">New York Code and Desgin Academy</a>, <a href="https://flatironschool.com/" target="_blank">Flatiron School</a>, <a href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/" target="_blank">Fullstack Academy</a> and <a href="https://www.bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc</a>. In the end, I went with the remote coding bootcamp Bloc. There was a possibility that my wife and I could move to a new city for her work, the price was similar to equivalent bootcamps, 1-to-1 mentorship was the core of the program and the career support was built into the curriculum.

Before starting Bloc, here's what I felt comfortable working in:
* Content Management Systems like Wordpress and Squarespace
* HTML
* CSS

After 11 weeks of Bloc curriculum, here's what I feel comfortable working in:
* Content Management Systems like Wordpress and Squarespace
* HTML
* CSS
* Git & GitHub
* JavaScript
* DOM Scripting
* jQuery
* Angular

The curriculum moves fast and I learned more in the first two weeks of Bloc than learning on my own for an entire year. Yes, the curriculum is good. However, I attribute the quantity of information I've been able to learn in a relatively short period of time to meeting with my mentor twice a week and answering my questions daily.

In just a few more months, I'll find out if enrolling in a bootcamp was worth it. Upon completing Bloc, I'll consider my coding bootcamp experience a success if I have the tools to work for a company as a developer, I know how to continue learning more about code, I have joined a number of developer communities and I have created a super cool portfolio.
