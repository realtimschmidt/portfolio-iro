title: Documentation is sexier than you think
---
TL;DR - Documentation indirectly improves the user experience by improving the developer experience. Sexy, I know.

Creating your very frist page on the Internet is extremely exciting. Something inside you happens after navigating to your own URL and refresh the page subsiquently changing "Hello World" to "Hi Mom! I'm on the Internet!" .... Over time, that feeling gets erroded by deadlines, broken links, and clients changing their mind 6 times. What was a fun, new and exciting has now become work. 


Part of developing websites is learning new content management systems, languages, libraries, frameworks and keeping up with new technology in general. There's a lot to learn.
