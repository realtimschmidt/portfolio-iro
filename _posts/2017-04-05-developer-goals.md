title: My Goals as a Frontend developer
---
TL;DR - TBD

* Become proficient at learning about a technology, not just how to consume it
* Make digital products for my personal life that I'm missing or don't like what already exists
* Continue working as a freelancer but offer development services or become employed as a developer. Which ever is more attractive.
