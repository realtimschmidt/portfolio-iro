I'm a freelance developer with a few regular clients.

When I'm not making things on the Internet, you can find me <a href="/img/tim-city-of-lakes-loppet.jpg" target="_blank">cross country skiing</a>, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/timothyschmidt/18182009812/" target="_blank">knitting sweaters</a>, watching baseball and enjoying whichever city I happen to be living in.

Interested in working with me? <a href="/contact">Send me a note</a> and we'll chat soon.
