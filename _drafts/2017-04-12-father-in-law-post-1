This is the first installment of the “Father-In-Law Blog" posts. These infrequent and irregular posts serve as a guide for any techie who has run out of patience with their family asking them how to use their devices. Send your family here! I’ll respond to real questions I get from my real father-in-law and gather the best resources I can find online so they’re easy to access. If my father-in-law has these questions, I’m sure your family does too.

Why did I single out my father-in-law and does’t that seem dangerous for my continued existence? While my father-in-law may be limited in his technology skills he is as persistent as a child in asking questions related to technology. This means he’s also as fearless as a child when asking questions. His eagerness to learn about technology is contagious and I really enjoy answering his questions.

This week, I missed a phone call from my father-in-law. I looked at my wife to see if she had missed a call from her dad when he called me again. “You’re dad is calling, it must be important.” Before I could answer, the call was ended. I called back and he answered jovially “I’m at a party and didn’t mean to call you and then I accidentally called you twice. So sorry, gotta go!”

My father-in-law butt dials me 5-8 times a year. I’m not sure how a butt dial is possible with an iPhone but he manages to find a way no matter which version of the iPhone he has. Or, it’s a father-in-law prank to annoy the man who married is only daughter. Either scenario seem entirely possible.
